2D Java Game Engine built upon LWJGL, for a personnal project.

Starting date: January 1st, 2023
Each day corresponds to a day of work.

Progression:
Day1:
- Discovering LWJGL interface, dive into low-level Java programming
- Can only draw red triangles.
Day2:
- Added a ResourceManager class to centralize the access to resources files
- Added linux natives dependencies in gradle build
- Vertex shader can now take a color parameter. We can therefore draw nice rainbow triangles!
- Rendered triangles of textures (ugly code, has to be refactored next time)
Day3:
- Very nice refactoring!
- Created a 'component' package: everything that will be drawn will be a component.
- It is now possible to draw shapes or images with a single function call
- I will have to rewrite it though by implementing a new coordinate system and cleaning a bit the code
Day4:
- Learning about linear algebra, matrices: vital to understand the transformations that we will apply to our components
